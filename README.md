The provided Python code implements a simple trading strategy based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossovers.
The strategy aims to generate buy (1.0) and sell (-1.0) signals for a given financial instrument.
When the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA, a buy signal is generated (1.0). Conversely, when the longer EMA crosses above the shorter EMA, a sell signal is generated (-1.0). 
Importantly, once a signal is generated, it persists until a new and opposite signal is produced.
